# How to Use This Book

## Preamble

Pythia Foundations is intended to educate the reader on the essentials
for using the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE): a collection of
open source Python packages that support analysis, manipulation,
and visualization of scientific data. While Project Pythia is focused
on the geoscience communities, the material contained in Pythia
Foundations applies broadly, and may be useful to scientists, or
aspiring scientists, working in any number of disciplines. Pythia
Foundations makes very few assumptions about the experience level
of the reader other than having a background in math or science,
and being comfortable using a computer, including the command line
terminal (i.e. the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)).
Prior programming experience is not required.

Lastly, in addition to the Python language and a number of fundamental
scientific Python packages, Pythia Foundations covers two topics
that we believe are essential
to effectively using the SPE: GitHub, for sharing workflows and
managing code; and Jupyter Notebooks, the technology by which all
Pythia Foundations material is presented and which is quickly
becoming a standard format for scientific communication of computational
results.


```
% cd ~
% jupyter notebook
```

A local Jupyter Notebook server should open in your web browser.
Simply open the .ipynb file using the Notebook server’s file browser
and you are good to go. If you want to work with many Pythia Foundations
notebooks, you might want to “clone the site”
and download all of the notebooks. First click on the Pythia
Foundations GitHub icon (see figure below) and select repository.
Then follow the instructions in our Getting Started with GitHub
[guide](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-github.html#)
for cloning a repository. The steps used above for configuring your
Conda environment should work for this method as well.
